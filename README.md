# Memory Game Prototype
In this prototype you have a 3x2 grid of "cards" you can uncover to find their pair in the quickest time posible.

I made this to better understand how to work with nodes, especifically Control Nodes and how to change their behavior when pressing a button.

You can try it [here](https://jislein.github.io/memory-game-prototype/).
